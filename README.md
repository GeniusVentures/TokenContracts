# GeniusTokens Smart Contracts 

## The gnus-token directory contains the Initial Token Offering contract using OpenZeppelin.
* The contract takes ETH (Ethereum) and returns GNUS Tokens.
* 20% is reserved for the developers and on-going enhancements to Genius AI processing System as well as to Game Developers to develop games 
* 20% will be put into wrapped tokens (GNUS/ETH) using Uniswap for liquidity and stability of the GNUS tokens
* The remaining 60% will be left in the ICO Contract until the AI Processing system is used and the GNUS tokens are used for AI/ML Processing.

## The gnus-ai directory contains a smart contract for the Escrow and Payment Splits among the AI Proccessing devices and also is using OpenZeppelin upgradeable Diamonds.
* The AI contract will become a minter of new tokens as GNUS tokens are burned and new AI Processing Jobs are added by customers
* The payment splits are using an escrow and the GNUS tokens are converted to an off-chain token system called Super Genius (SGNUS)
* The SGNUS tokens are 'mined' with a real proof-of-work system (AI/ML Processing) and the App/Game User will receive 70% of the tokens
* The developer of the game/app will receive 20% of the SGNUS tokens
* 10% of the SGNUS tokens will be burnt allowing for natural deflation
